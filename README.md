## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze historical IT support data (2016–2020)
- Identify agent performance variations
- Evaluate satisfaction vs. resolution time correlation
- Project impact of tech investment on efficiency
- Provide recommendations for process improvement

## 🚀 Key Insights
- **Average Resolution Time:** 4.55 days  
- **Average Satisfaction Rate:** 4.10 / 5  
- **Fastest Age Group:** 49–53 years (avg. 4.11 days)  
- **Highest Satisfaction Group:** 37–40 years (avg. 4.23)  
- **42%** of tickets resolved within **0–2 days**  
- **Weak correlation** (-0.0036) between resolution time & satisfaction

## 📈 Visual Highlights
- **Resolution Time Distribution Chart** — majority resolved within 2 days  
- **Trend Analysis** — ticket volume steadily increased till 2020  
- **Demographic Segmentation** — younger agents slightly faster but less consistent

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting)  
- PowerPoint (Insights Presentation)  
- Statistical Analysis (Correlation, Trend Projection)

## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Invest in ticket management software** → likely to reduce resolution times.  
2. **Offer targeted training** for mid-performing agents (ages 33–44).  
3. **Monitor agent consistency** using standard deviation of resolution times.  
4. **Encourage knowledge sharing** among high-satisfaction performers.
